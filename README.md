# Yogi and the Snails
Yea it is a terrible name but it is a very apt description of the game.

This is an endless (platformer in the future?) side-scrolling, Mario-ish kind of game? But it's implemented from scratch with I learned from my UI classes. It has a very nice jumping 'feeling' that I'm really proud of, because it behaved just like I wanted it to, and it reminds me of the satisfying jumps I used to do in Maple Story.
